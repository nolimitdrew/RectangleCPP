# RectangleCPP
Rectangle Class C++ Program

This repository contains a simple C++ program that demonstrates the use of classes and objects. The program defines a class called "Rectangle" that represents a rectangle and calculates its area. It consists of three files:

1. Rectangle.h: This header file defines the Rectangle class with private member variables for length and width, along with public member functions for constructor, getting the length, width, and area of the rectangle.

2. Rectangle.cpp: This implementation file contains the definitions of the member functions declared in the Rectangle class header file.

3. main.cpp: This file contains the main function where an instance of the Rectangle class is created, and the length, width, and area of the rectangle are printed to the console.

Usage:
To compile and run the program, follow these steps:
1. Make sure you have a C++ compiler (e.g., g++) installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or download the three files.
3. Open a terminal in the folder containing the files.
4. Execute the following commands:
      g++ -c Rectangle.cpp -o Rectangle.o
      g++ main.cpp Rectangle.o -o main
      ./main

The program will compile and run, displaying the length, width, and area of the rectangle.

Feel free to use this program as a starting point for your own projects or to learn about classes and objects in C++. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to open an issue or submit a pull request.

Thank you!
